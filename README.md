### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst! I am focused on growing an informed society; bringing needed information to the right people at the right time. I am passionate about technology and big data, drawing inferences from data to help individuals and organisations make informed decisions to tenaciously impact positive changes in & through the Information Technology sector into other sectors.

Talk about Technology and you'd find me in the forefront in the nearest future. 

I also look forward to partnership, networking and internship opportunities. Feel free to reach me via email: rachealibamidele@gmail.com.

More to come in the days ahead...
âš¡ Fun fact: I can read! When I'm serious I read, and when I want to unwind, I read as well (novels thoughðŸ˜€).
