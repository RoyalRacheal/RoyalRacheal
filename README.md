### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and a Knowledge Manager! I am focused on growing an informed society; bringing needed information/knowledge to the right people at the right time. I look forward to doing this giving value for value.

I am passionate about ICT(I love technology and the adventures that come with it) and I am starting off with Data Science because I love to draw inferences from data, helping people and organizations make informed decisions.

Talk about Technology and you'd find me in the forefront in the nearest future. 

I also look forward to partnership, networking and internship opportunities. Feel free to reach me via email: rachealibamidele@gmail.com.

More to come in the days ahead...
âš¡ Fun fact: I can read! When I'm serious I read, and when I want to unwind, I read as well (novels thoughðŸ˜€).
