### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst passionate about leveraging technology and big data to inform and empower individuals and organizations for impactful decision-making.
Talk about Technology and you will find me at the forefront in the near future. 

I also look forward to partnership, networking and internship opportunities. Feel free to reach me via email: rachealibamidele@gmail.com.

More to come in the days ahead...
âš¡ Fun fact: I can read! When I'm serious I read, and when I want to unwind, I read as well (novels thoughðŸ˜€).
